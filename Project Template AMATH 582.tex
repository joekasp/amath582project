\par Computational chemistry seeks to construct fine-grained models of chemical systems in order to model and predict experimentally observable quantities in support of experimental research.  A major implementation of computational modeling is the construction of idealized chemical spectra, which are essentially the 'fingerprints' of a chemical species in a system of interest.  Traditionally, spectra have been generated experimentally, but recently have been generated from models of molecular electronic structure which comprises a major field of study in the computational chemistry community.  However, generating predictive spectra from model and simulation can be a difficult undertaking, as the number of degrees of freedom for a so-called \emph{full configuration} solution increases exponentially (or factorially!) for each additional electron found in the system. Full configuration calculations are ideal for capturing \emph{all} of the physics of a system, but come at great computational expense as every interaction between each particle must be accounted for in the Hamiltonian and the second-order differential \emph{Schr\"odinger Equation} solved numerically.  If atomic nuclear dynamics are also modeled, this increases the complexity even further as each solution for each time step.  Consequently, approximations and calculation schemes that minimize the complexity and computational cost of a model are highly valued in the field. Accordingly, techniques for reducing or removing the necessity of small time-steps and long timescales are also of great utility, as dynamical simulations examining nuclear motion often require picosecond timescales to capture the physics of interest whereas models examining only electronic dynamics require only femtosecond timescales.\\ 

\par Things are not so bleak, however, as there is an abundance of mathematical techniques for reducing the scale of such problems. This study focuses on one such technique called \emph{Compressed Sensing} (CS) that is used in data analysis to reduce the necessary sampling rate. CS does this by assuming a high degree of sparsity in a signal and makes use of the $L^{1}$ norm minimization technique to locate the vector of signal transform coefficients that is the most sparse.  

 As CS is frequently applied to time-frequency analysis problems, we apply it to modeled chemical spectra which heavily feature Fourier analysis for signal resolution.  In the case of Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the Fourier transform is used to present a frequency spectrum characteristic to a specific chemical species.  IR makes use of the vibrational frequencies of molecular bonds, which can be thought of as springs upon which the atoms oscillate in semiclassical picture, and the vibrational modes for different bond types are excited by specific IR frequencies of radiation.

%IDEAL CASES

\subsection*{A.	Ideal Data Cases}
In order to test the validity of our CS algorithm for data reconstruction, we first applied it to idealized data sets represented by known linear combinations of sinusoidal functions. Having knowledge of the exact "signal" \emph{a priori} allows us to determine the sampling rates and discrete transforms that result in the best approximations under ideal conditions.
